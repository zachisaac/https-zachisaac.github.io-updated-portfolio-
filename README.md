# Updated-Portfolio

This is my updated classwork portfolio. It chronicles the homework assignments we have been given and how I have progressed as a student from the beginning of the course till now. I have decided to use Materialize instead of Bootstrap for this assignment because I prefer it's overall look and style. Thus, I have decided to update all the pages to a new format with proper responsivness.
